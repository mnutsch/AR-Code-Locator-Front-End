Background:
AR.js is a framework for creating augmented reality experiences which are accessible through the web. A user loads an AR.js webpage in a mobile device. The page displays the device's camera and overlays an AR scene on a designated flat image (AKA "target marker"). For more info, see: https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/blob/master/README.md

High Level Project Description:
For my project I created a web API which allows users to submit and find AR.js markers by geolocation. I also created an Android app which allows users to submit new AR.js target marker records, as well as find target markers near their present location.
